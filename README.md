# Cyber-Threat-Hunting
Threat Hunting notes and projects

This repository will be updated as I collect more knowledge in threat hunting. Currently, I want to make sure I annotate the information I collect before I move on to other areas in cyber.

Hopefully this repository will be helpful for anyone else who is starting out in threat hunting and needs a good place to start learning.

The IoC script contained in this repository will take an excel file full of IoCs and convert them into suricata rules so can be uploaded into the IDS for detection perposes. This can be useful in intel driven threat hunts.
