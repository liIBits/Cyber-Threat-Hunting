# Cyber-Threat-Hunting
Threat Hunting notes and projects

This repository will be updated as I collect more knowledge in threat hunting. Currently, I want to make sure I annotate the information I collect before I move on to other areas in cyber.

Hopefully this repository will be helpful for anyone else who is starting out in threat hunting and needs a good place to start learning.
